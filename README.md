                                                            **Introduction to Bubble Game**


Bubble game was created based on one of Atari's most popular games called Bubbles which was released on 1989. The flash version of bubble game which is called "Bubble Shooter" is easy to operate, extremely fun, and requires no special skills to play.
The rules of the bubble game are really simple, you need to blast as many bubbles as possible, the more you pop, the higher your score is, but you must not let the bubbles touch the ground as this will end your game and you will have to start all over again. Sounds easy? Rest assured that people are spending hours blasting those bubbles and having the time of their lives.
The only way to pop bubbles is to get 3 or more consecutive bubbles with the same color lined up and you do so buy using your only weapon - the cannon which is attached to an arrow at the bottom of your game screen.
Using your mouse you can point the cannon to the exact direction you choose and then with the click of your mouse you shoot the next bubble.
The cannon always show the color of the next bubble you are going to shot so you have to plan ahead before shooting to make sure you will get those 3 or more bubble lined up.
You don't necessarily have to blast bubbles on each fire you make, planning ahead can be real necessity in this game, but you must be sure that you have where to shot at because the minute those bubbles touch the ground, that's it, game over.
Another important rule to know about the game world is that the walls are like mirrors. If you shoot a bubble towards an exposed wall, it will not stick to the wall but will bounce right back like a stream of light against a mirror.
This feature becomes really handful when the center of your screen is filled up with and you need to shoot some bubbles on the sidebars.
Talking about bubble games cannot be complete without mentioning another classic game called "Bubble Bobble" which was release by Taito on 1986. In this platform game you play a dragon (or two) that can blow bubbles. You trap your enemies in bubbles and when you pop those bubbles your enemy is gone. You can play 'Bubble Bobble' on this site.
Following the great success of bubble shooter, more bubble games appeared in the late couple of years of-course many online flash versions of these games are now available.
Also, it became so popular that you can play it on almost every gadget you can get your hands on (cell phones, PDAs and so).
You are ready to start popping those bubbles now! be careful not to spend all your time doing so, it's addictive.
